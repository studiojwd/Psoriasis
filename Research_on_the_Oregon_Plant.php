    <h1>Research on the Oregon plant</h1>
    <p>OGR is a native plant of North America and has been extensively examined as a treatment for <strong>psoriasis</strong> in several published studies. These studies have found that compounds isolated from extracts of OGR possess inhibitory activity against Lipoxygenase (an enzyme involved in psoriatic skin cell production). </p>

    <p>At the cellular level, OGR has been shown to guard against accelerated activity during the process of keratinocytes (skin cell production).</p>

    <strong>Botanicals in dermatology: an evidence-based review.</strong><br/>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
Botanical extracts and single compounds are increasingly used in cosmetics but also in over-the-counter drugs and food supplements. The focus of the present review is on controlled clinical trials with botanicals in the treatment of acne, inflammatory skin diseases, skin infections, UV-induced skin damage, skin cancer, alopecia, vitiligo, and wounds. Studies with botanical cosmetics and drugs are discussed, as well as studies with botanical food supplements. Experimental research on botanicals was considered to a limited extent when it seemed promising for clinical use in the near future. In acne therapy, Mahonia, tea tree oil, and Saccharomyces may have the potential to become standard treatments. Mahonia, Hypericum, Glycyrrhiza and some traditional Chinese medicines appear promising for atopic dermatitis. Some plant-derived substances like dithranol and methoxsalen (8-methoxypsoralen) [in combination with UVA] are already accepted as standard treatments in <strong>psoriasis</strong>; Mahonia and Capsicum (capsaicin) are the next candidates suggested by present evidence. Oral administration and topical application of antioxidant plant extracts (green and black tea, carotenoids, coffee, and many flavonoids from fruits and vegetables) can protect skin from UV-induced erythema, early aging, and irradiation-induced cancer. Hair loss and vitiligo are also traditional fields of application for botanicals. According to the number and quality of clinical trials with botanicals, the best evidence exists for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, i.e. atopic dermatitis and <strong>psoriasis</strong>. However, many more controlled clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and risks of plant-derived products in dermatology. Safety aspects, especially related to sensitization and photodermatitis, have to be taken into account. Therefore, clinicians should not only be informed of the beneficial effects but also the specific adverse effects of botanicals used for dermatologic disorders and cosmetic purposes.<br/>

    <strong>A report on three recent clinical trials using Mahonia aquifolium 10% topical cream and a review of the worldwide clinical experience with Mahonia aquifolium for the treatment of plaque <strong>psoriasis</strong>.</strong><br/>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
This monograph summarizes 3 recent clinical trials and the worldwide clinical experience with Mahonia aquifolium in patients with <strong>psoriasis</strong>. Study 1 was an open-label study to evaluate the safety of Mahonia aquifolium in 39 patients treated for 12 weeks. Assessments made were modified PASI, global assessment, <strong>psoriasis</strong> history questionnaire, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and <strong>psoriasis</strong> Disability Index. The results indicate statistically significant improvement in PASI score and Dermatology Life Quality Index after 4 weeks of treatment. This response continued 1 month after the end of treatment. Study 2 was a clinical trial of 32 patients with mild to moderate bilateral <strong>psoriasis</strong> treated up to 6 months. One side of the body received Mahonia and the other standard psoriatic treatment (eg, Dovonex cream). The primary outcomes were patient ratings of the Mahonia-treated side alone and the comparison between treatments received on each side of their body. Eighty-four percent of patients rated the Mahonia-treated <strong>psoriasis</strong> as good to excellent response. When compared with standard treatment, 63% of patients rated Mahonia aquifolium equal to or better than the standard psoriatic treatment. Study 3 was an observational study of 33 patients with mild to moderate bilateral <strong>psoriasis</strong> treated for 1 month. The results indicate improvement in <strong>psoriasis</strong> after 1 week of treatment. The side treated with Mahonia did as well or better than the side treated with the vehicle cream. Results from these 3 open-label clinical trials are in agreement with published data that include placebo-controlled studies. Taken together, these clinical studies conducted by several investigators in several countries indicate that Mahonia aquifolium is a safe and effective treatment of patients with mild to moderate <strong>psoriasis</strong>.</p>

    <strong>Lipoxygenase inhibition and antioxidant properties of bisbenzylisoqunoline alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium.</strong><br/>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
Products of lipoxygenase metabolism are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of <strong>psoriasis</strong>. Six bisbenzylisoquinoline (BBIQ) alkaloids, oxyacanthine, armoline, baluchistine, berbamine, obamegine, aquifoline, isolated from Mahonia aquifolium, were tested for lipoxygenase inhibition. Berbamine and oxyacanthine were the most potent lipoxygenase inhibitors, whereas aromoline and baluchistine exhibited only very low potencies. Oxyacanthine and berbamine were also among the most active compounds to inhibit lipid peroxidation. Between the results of lipoxygenase inhibition and the lipid peroxidation a linear correlation was found (r = 0.9533). Our data suggest that in the mechanism of lipoxygenase inhibition by these alkaloids, inhibition of lipid peroxide substrate accumulation, either by direct reaction with peroxide or by scavenging or lipid-derived radicals, may play a role. Inhibition of lipoxygenase by these compounds may contribute to the therapeutic effect of Mahonia aquifolium extracts in treatment of diseases in pathogenesis of which he products of lipoxygenase metabolism are involved.</p>

    <strong>Effects of Mahonia aquifolium ointment on the expression of adhesion, proliferation, and activation markers in the skin of patients with <strong>psoriasis</strong>.</strong><br/>

    <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
    OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of topical therapy with Mahonia aquifolium on the expression of pathogenetically relevant molecules in psoriatic skin by immunohistochemistry. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective-randomized, half-side comparison study with subsequent immunohistochemical assessment of biopsies. METHODS: The study areas were treated with Mahonia aquifolium ointment 3( daily and with dithranol in rising concentrations 1( daily, respectively. Biopsies of lesional skin from the test areas were carried out in 49 patients a) prior to therapy and b) 4 weeks after the start of therapy. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed with the following monoclonal antibodies: anti-ICAM-1, -CD3, -HLA-DR, -keratin 6, -keratin 16, -Ki-67. Evaluation of staining was made by two independent examiners using established semiquantitative scores. RESULTS: Marked staining with all of the cited monoclonal antibodies was observed in the lesional skin prior to therapy. After 4 weeks of therapy there was a marked reduction in the expressions of ICAM-1, CD 3, HLA-DR and keratin 6 and 16. There were significantly greater reductions of ICAM-1, CD3, and HLA-DR at sites treated with dithranol. The expression of Ki-67 was not reduced by either therapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate efficacy of Mahonia aquifolium and dithranol in psoriatic skin both on cellular cutaneous immune mechanisms and on the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. The effect of dithranol appears to be more potent than that of Mahonia aquifolium.

    <strong>The antipsoriatic Mahonia aquifolium and its active constituents; II. Antiproliferative activity against cell growth of human keratinocytes.</strong><br/>
Muller K, Ziereis K, Gawlik I.<br/>
    <strong>Abstract</strong><br/>
The extract of the bark of Mahonia aquifolium is an inhibitor of keratinocyte growth with an IC50 of 35 microM. Of its main alkaloids tested, berberine inhibited cell growth to the same extent as did the Mahonia extract, while the benzylisoquinoline alkaloids berbamine and oxyacanthine were more potent inhibitors by a factor of three.</p>
