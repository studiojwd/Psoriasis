    <h1>Research on Oregon Grape Root Range</h1>
        <p>The Oregon Grape Root range has had two trials carried out on it. These are not medicinal trials but trials to establish that they are suitable for use on people prone to <strong><strong>psoriasis</strong></strong> and that the products perform as per their design.</p>

        <p>A two-month trail, carried out by a UK doctor on 50 people, found that the maintenance cream improved the skin of 86% <strong><strong>psoriasis</strong></strong> sufferers, with 75% of these experiencing a marked improvement after just four weeks of use.</p>

        <p>A further trial on the scalps of students from The City of Bath College who had disorders of the scalp such as persistent dandruff, dermatitis, eczema, <strong><strong>psoriasis</strong></strong> etc., or had experienced sensitivity to hair products, were asked to use the products for four weeks and then give their response. The response was an excellent 86% success rate for the shampoo and a 80% score for the conditioner. The testers found that the shampoo and conditioner significantly improved the condition of their scalp, left it feeling cleansed and also left their hair with a salon standard finish.</p>
